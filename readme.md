# SIP Returns Calculator

## Introduction
The purpose of this tiny project is to calculate the returns generated over
a period of time if the stock was bought in a systematic way or commonly known as a SIP

This is built on the popular python library **yfinance** which helps you to get data from
**Yahoo Finance**, hence all the ticker symbols needs to be input as it is shown in the website

An example input sheet is given in the repo for users to begin with.

## Usage

1. Please use standary means of executing this python program within a pipenv.
2. There are two modes
   1. '1' which will use the xlsx as input
   2. '2' which will take command line user input via helful prompt texts and output the resuts on the command line itself
3. This is a typer program hence the *--help* command line argument will give you all the supported arguments
